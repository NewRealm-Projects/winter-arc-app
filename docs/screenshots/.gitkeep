# Screenshots

This directory will contain app screenshots for the README.

To generate screenshots:
1. Run `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to different pages (Dashboard, Leaderboard)
3. Take screenshots in both light and dark mode
4. Save as:
   - `dashboard-light.png`
   - `dashboard-dark.png`
   - `leaderboard.png`

Alternatively, use Playwright to auto-generate:
```bash
npm run e2e:screenshots
```
