#
# CI Pipeline - Quality Gate (Optimized with Depot.dev)
#
# Runs on: All branches and pull requests
# Purpose: Lint, typecheck, test, and build the application
# Jobs: lint || typecheck || test → build (parallel where possible)
#
# Optimizations:
# - Depot.dev for 2-3x faster CI runs
# - Multi-layer caching (npm, Vite, TypeScript, ESLint, Vitest)
# - Maximum parallelization
# - Incremental builds
#
# This is the primary quality gate that must pass before any deployment.
# All deployment workflows depend on this workflow completing successfully.
