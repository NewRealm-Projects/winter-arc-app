# Dashboard Specification Delta

## MODIFIED Requirements

### R-DASH-001: Dashboard Layout and Structure

**Current**: Dashboard uses React Router for navigation and Vite build system with client-side rendering only.

**Modified**: Dashboard uses Next.js App Router with layout components and supports both SSR and client-side rendering.

#### Scenario: Next.js Layout Structure
- **Given** a user accesses the dashboard
- **When** Next.js renders the dashboard page
- **Then** the layout should be consistent across all dashboard routes
- **And** navigation should work with Next.js Link components

#### Scenario: SSR Dashboard Performance
- **Given** a user visits the dashboard URL directly
- **When** Next.js performs server-side rendering
- **Then** the initial dashboard state should be rendered on the server
- **And** the page should load faster with proper SSR hydration

### R-DASH-003: Component Organization

**Current**: Dashboard components located in src/components/ with Vite import resolution.

**Modified**: Dashboard components located in app/components/ with Next.js import resolution and App Router compatibility.

#### Scenario: Component Import Resolution
- **Given** dashboard components need to import other components
- **When** Next.js builds the application
- **Then** all component imports should resolve correctly with @/ aliases
- **And** TypeScript should provide proper type checking

## ADDED Requirements

### R-DASH-010: Next.js App Router Integration

#### Scenario: File-based Routing
- **Given** the dashboard has multiple sub-pages
- **When** a user navigates to /dashboard/settings
- **Then** Next.js should route to app/dashboard/settings/page.tsx
- **And** the correct dashboard sub-page should be rendered

### R-DASH-011: Layout Persistence

#### Scenario: Shared Dashboard Layout
- **Given** a user navigates between dashboard pages
- **When** using Next.js routing
- **Then** the dashboard layout should persist across page changes
- **And** only the page content should re-render
