# Database Migration Specification

## REMOVED Requirements

### Requirement: Firebase Firestore Integration

The system SHALL no longer use Firebase Firestore as the primary database.

**Current**: Firebase Firestore NoSQL database with collections for users, tracking, groups.

**Removed**: Complete removal of Firestore dependencies and client SDK usage.

#### Scenario: Firestore Removal
- **WHEN** the migration is complete
- **THEN** no Firebase Firestore calls SHALL remain in the codebase
- **AND** all data SHALL be migrated to Vercel Postgres
- **AND** Firebase Firestore SDK SHALL be removed from dependencies

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Vercel Postgres Integration

The system SHALL use Vercel Postgres as the primary SQL database for all data storage.

#### Scenario: Postgres Connection
- **WHEN** the application starts
- **THEN** it SHALL establish a connection to Vercel Postgres
- **AND** connection pooling SHALL be properly configured
- **AND** environment variables SHALL be properly loaded

#### Scenario: SQL Schema Implementation
- **WHEN** the database is initialized
- **THEN** all required tables SHALL be created with proper relationships
- **AND** indexes SHALL be optimized for query performance
- **AND** foreign key constraints SHALL maintain data integrity

### Requirement: Data Migration from Firestore

The system SHALL migrate all existing data from Firebase Firestore to Vercel Postgres.

#### Scenario: User Data Migration
- **WHEN** user data is migrated
- **THEN** all user profiles SHALL be transferred to the users table
- **AND** authentication references SHALL be updated to new system
- **AND** no user data SHALL be lost during migration

#### Scenario: Tracking Data Migration
- **WHEN** tracking data is migrated
- **THEN** all daily tracking entries SHALL be transferred to tracking table
- **AND** date formats SHALL be normalized for SQL compatibility
- **AND** data relationships SHALL be maintained through foreign keys

### Requirement: SQL Query Optimization

The system SHALL implement optimized SQL queries for all data operations.

#### Scenario: Performance Optimization
- **WHEN** database queries are executed
- **THEN** queries SHALL use proper indexes for fast retrieval
- **AND** complex queries SHALL be optimized for minimal execution time
- **AND** connection pooling SHALL prevent connection exhaustion

### Requirement: Database Schema Design

The system SHALL implement a normalized relational schema optimized for fitness tracking data.

#### Scenario: Relational Data Structure
- **WHEN** data is stored in the database
- **THEN** it SHALL follow proper normalization principles
- **AND** relationships SHALL be enforced through foreign keys
- **AND** data integrity SHALL be maintained through constraints
