## Technical Notes

### Implementation Files
- `src/utils/pushupAlgorithm.ts` - Plan generation, evaluation, history retrieval
- `src/components/PushupTile.tsx` - Dashboard tile, quick input modal
- `src/pages/PushupTrainingPage.tsx` - Guided workout mode UI

### Data Model
```typescript
PushupState {
  baseReps: number;      // Current base reps per set
  sets: number;          // Number of sets (5 or 4 with deload)
  restTime: number;      // Rest between sets (60s)
}

PushupWorkout {
  reps: number[];        // 5 reps per set
  status: 'pass' | 'hold' | 'fail';
  timestamp: Date;
}

DailyTracking {
  pushups: {
    total: number;       // Total pushups for the day
    workout?: PushupWorkout;
  }
}
```

### Algorithms
- **Progressive Overload**: `total_today = last_total + 1`
- **Base Reps Init**: `baseReps = max(3, floor(0.45 * maxPushups))`
- **Set Distribution**: Descending pattern with gap-based spacing
- **Deload Guard**: Sets = 4 if `baseReps * 5 > 120`

### Dependencies
- Zustand (state management)
- date-fns (date formatting)
- React Router (navigation)
- Firebase Firestore (persistence)
- AI Service (motivation generation)

### Design Patterns
- Progressive overload (+1 rep/day)
- Auto-progression based on performance
- Deload mechanism for volume management
- Dual input modes (quick vs guided)
- Historical date support
