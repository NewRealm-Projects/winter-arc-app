## Technical Notes

### Implementation Files
- `src/components/dashboard/WeeklyTile.tsx` - Week overview with day circles
- `src/components/UnifiedTrainingCard.tsx` - Combined training load + sports
- `src/components/PushupTile.tsx` - Pushup tracking tile
- `src/components/WaterTile.tsx` - Water intake tile
- `src/components/ProteinTile.tsx` - Protein intake tile
- `src/components/WeightTile.tsx` - Weight history tile

### Data Sources
- `tracking/{userId}/entries/{dateKey}` - Daily tracking entries
- `trainingLoad` state - 7-day training load map
- `checkIns` state - Daily check-in data
- `smartContributions` - Smart Notes AI contributions

### Dependencies
- Zustand (state management)
- date-fns (date manipulation)
- recharts (weight chart)
- WeekContext (week navigation)
- useCombinedTracking (manual + smart data)

### Design Patterns
- **Debouncing**: Water tile uses 180ms debounce for quick-add
- **Combined tracking**: All tiles merge manual + smart contributions
- **Multi-date**: All tiles respect selectedDate from week navigation
- **Progressive enhancement**: Tiles show goal progress when available
- **Responsive**: Mobile-first with desktop enhancements
